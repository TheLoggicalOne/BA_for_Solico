Instead of trying to find the one thing that will happen, our goal is to understand the chances of different possibilities.</p> <ul> <li>The Future is a Distribution, Not a Number: A point forecast (\"we will sell 10,000 units\") is fragile. A probabilistic view (\"there's a 60% chance of selling between 8,000-12,000 units, but a 10% chance of selling less than 5,000\") is robust. It allows us to manage risk and make better decisions.</li> <li>The Power of Thinking in Ranges: This is a proven strategy. In professional poker, the best players stopped trying to guess their opponent's exact hand. They started thinking about their opponent's range of possible hands and used mathematics to play optimally against that entire range. They embraced uncertainty and dominated.

This is where we must move beyond simple numbers and start thinking about probability distributions.
