# Resources & Tools

This page will serve as a central hub for all supplementary materials shared throughout the course.

## Supplementary Articles
As we cover new topics, I will post links to relevant articles and concept notes here. These are intended to provide deeper insight and real-world context beyond the textbook.

-   **Article 1:** *The Role of the Data Scientist in the Age of AI* (Coming Soon)

## Jupyter Notebooks
For certain topics, I will provide optional Jupyter (Python) Notebooks to demonstrate concepts visually or show an end-to-end analysis. These are for enrichment and do not require any programming knowledge to understand the key takeaways.

-   Links to notebooks will be posted here as they become available.

## Textbook Data
As mentioned in the syllabus, some proprietary data from the 7th edition of the textbook may not be available. When we cover examples from the book, I will provide links to the equivalent datasets we will be using here.

-   Dataset links will be posted here.
