## Problems
### Problem 1: What do you think about [Flaw of Averages](../concepts/flaw_of_averages.md)? What is wrong with it?
- Find examples of Flaw of Averages,in personal and business decision making
### Prolem 2: Estimate chance of success Bernouli random variable from data
- $ X $ is a Bernouli random variable with probability of success equal to $ p $, p is unknown to us.  
in other words, $ P(X=1) = p $
- We know the result of one trial, which was success ( $ X=1 $)
- What can we say about $p$? How can we predict result of future trials of $X$?
- What if we know the result of more than one trials?
- Solve problem 6 of [week 5](week05.md)

### Problem 3: Estimating production volume from single data
- Your competitor has started to produce a very special product. You want to know how many they have  
produced so far.
- Fortunately for you, they have numbered their productions: 1, 2, 3, ...You buy one, which  
is numbered 120
    - What can you say about their production volume?   
- You buy some more product, their numbers are: 33, 170, 220, 160...
    - What can you say about their production volume?  

- Solve problem 5 of [week 5](week05.md)

### Problem 4: Conider NCAA T-shirt problem, Should we do some research and survey?
- Consider the version where we know nothing about demand, is it a good idea to do some research?  
- How much should we spend on them?

### Problem 5: you are playing a simple dice game:
- You throw a dice, if the result is $ x $, you will win $ x $ dollar. How much are you willing to pay  
for each round of this game? What is the maximum value? You could play as many rounds as you want

- What if the dice is not fair, let say has following chances

### Problem 6: Consider problem 5 of [week 5](week05.md), how valuable is information or data here?
- How much are you willing to pay, to know the value of $ m $
- How much are you willing to pay for each single sample of data?
