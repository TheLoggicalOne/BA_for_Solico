Great! You're designing the **second session** of your *Business Analytics* course, and you want to:

---

### 🎯 **Session Goals**

* Show the **big picture of decision making**
* Emphasize the role of **mathematical models** in supporting decisions
* Discuss the **limits and assumptions** of models
* Position **probability, statistics, and simulation** in this process
* Reflect on what matters **most in the AI age**
* Engage participants with **motivating problems** that provoke thought

---

## 🧠 1. Conceptual Anchor: Decision = Model + Judgment

Open the session with this:

> "All models are wrong, but some are useful." – George Box

Use this to frame **why we model reality**, even if imperfectly.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Big Picture of Decision Making (Framework)

Draw or show this simplified flow:

```
[Real-World Problem]
       ↓
[Understanding / Assumptions]
       ↓
[Modeling] → [Computation / Optimization / Simulation]
       ↓
[Interpretation / Insights]
       ↓
[Real-World Action / Decision]
       ↓
[Feedback & Revision]
```

Now let's support this with real-world thinking challenges 👇

---

## 🔍 3. Motivating Thinking Problems (Real-World Inspired)

Each of these shows the **importance of modeling**, **limitations of models**, and **need for judgment**.

---

### **Problem 1: The Ice Cream Vendor at the Beach**

**Scenario**: You’re selling ice cream at a beach. You can bring 20, 40, or 60 ice creams in a cooler. If you bring too few, you lose customers. Too many, and they melt.

* How should you decide how many to bring?
* What variables matter?
* How would you model it?
* What information would you need?
* Can a mathematical model give you a perfect answer?

**Themes**: Uncertainty, demand modeling, trade-offs, simulation, model limits.

---

### **Problem 2: Hiring a New Team Member**

You must decide between two candidates:

* Candidate A has experience, high performance, but poor team fit
* Candidate B is a great team fit, eager to learn, but less experienced

You try to model future team productivity under each scenario.

* What are the variables?
* What can you quantify?
* What remains qualitative?
* Can a spreadsheet or formula help?

**Themes**: Judgment vs. modeling, soft factors, limited info.

---

### **Problem 3: The Bakery Optimization Problem**

You own a bakery and want to maximize profit:

* You make cakes and cookies
* Each uses flour, labor, and oven time
* There are constraints (supply, hours)

**Mathematical model possible**: Linear programming

Now:

* What if customer demand is uncertain?
* What if sugar price changes tomorrow?
* What if a big buyer suddenly walks in?

**Extension**: How would AI help you? What can it not do?

**Themes**: Optimization, assumptions, volatility, AI limitations

---

### **Problem 4: Marketing Budget Allocation**

You want to allocate a fixed budget between:

* TV ads
* Instagram influencers
* Search engine ads

You model conversions per dollar spent based on past data.

Now:

* What if your past data is outdated?
* What if influencer popularity suddenly changes?
* What if a competitor enters the market?

**Themes**: Statistics, assumptions, overfitting, causal inference, robustness

---

### **Problem 5: Pandemic Policy Planning**

Governments modeled lockdown policies using:

* Infection rates
* Mobility data
* ICU capacity

But:

* Data was uncertain and delayed
* Behavioral reactions were unpredictable
* Ethical concerns arose (freedom vs. safety)

Ask: Can any model capture all of this? What should the role of the model be?

**Themes**: Systems thinking, simulation, complexity, uncertainty, judgment

---

## 💡 4. Interactive Prompt

Ask participants:

> Think of a decision **you or your team recently made**.
>
> * Did you use a model (even an informal one)?
> * What was known vs. uncertain?
> * How would a mathematical model help?
> * What could it miss?

This encourages **personal reflection** and sets the stage for modeling concepts.

---

## 🧠 5. Bonus: AI-Age Emphasis

Close with discussion:

* AI and data help build better models
* But **understanding** the **fit between model and real world** becomes even **more important**
* Humans are still needed for:

  * Framing the problem
  * Choosing the right model type
  * Judging when the model’s outputs don’t apply
  * Ethical considerations

---

## 🧰 Would You Like Slides or Handouts?

I can generate:

* A slide deck outline
* Markdown or PDF handout summarizing the big picture
* Jupyter Notebook or Excel-based modeling demos (for the bakery or budget problem)

Let me know what you’d like next.
