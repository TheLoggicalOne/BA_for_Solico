# Syllabus & Course Structure

This page contains all the logistical details for our 14-week program.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

-   **Develop scientific thinking** as a decision-making mindset.
-   Understand the evolution of decision-making: from intuition to mathematical model and role of  
data analysis in discovery of probabilistic model.
-   **Frame business problems** as decision problems under uncertainty.
-   **Think probabilistically:** move from numbers to random variables, understand randomness,  
variation, and the role of distributions.
-   Interpret statistical results (e.g., p-values, regression output) critically and in context.
-   Use regression, simulation, and decision trees as part of a broader decision-making strategy.
-   Move beyond predictive modeling to **decision modeling**.
-   Build confidence in evaluating analyses, identifying flaws, and asking sharper questions.
-   Translate business intuition into models‚Äîand model results back into strategic decisions.

    - problem solving and d competition strategy, and project  
    discussion, exercises,  
    

**üìçLocation:**¬†Solico Group  
**üíº Format:**

- First 30 mins: Discussion & case reflection  
    
- Lectures + Demos + Group activities  
    
- Hands-on Excel/Power BI/Spreadsheet work  
    

**üìï Materials:**

- _Business Analytics_¬†textbook  
    
- Solico case studies (custom-prepared)  
    
- Spreadsheets & datasets shared weekly

##  Session Structure
Each weekly lecture is divided into two structured parts:

- **Interactive Part**: Delivered in a **question-and-answer format**, encouraging active participation, reflection, and discussion. This part draws out intuition and connects abstract ideas to real business logic.

    - Usually first and last 10 minutes of each 1.5 hour Session will be interactive(at least)

- **Lecture Part**: Conceptual delivery similar to watching a video, with clear explanations, structured examples, and visual material. Questions are welcome, but will be answered at appropriate intervals to maintain the logical flow.

## Materials & Delivery

-   **Thinking Problems:** To spark reflection, you'll receive a problem 3 days before each session.
-   **Weekly Slides:** Conceptual lecture slides will be provided in English.
-   **Jupyter Notebooks (Optional):** Select concepts will be illustrated using Python notebooks to showcase end-to-end  
workflows and highlight key lessons. No programming knowledge is required.
-   **Supplementary Articles:** I will share articles to deepen your understanding.
-   **Lectures:** All live lectures will be delivered in Farsi.

## Assessment, Feedback & Anonymity

Your progress will be supported through practical exercises, projects, and a friendly competition. To encourage honest and  
thoughtful feedback, we will use an anonymous system for surveys and quizzes.

-   At the start of the course, you will each choose a **random unique ID** (e.g., "Falcon42").
-   Please use this same ID for all surveys and quizzes. This allows me to track learning progress while ensuring your  
psychological safety.

## Note on Book Data and Tools

The proprietary datasets from the 7th edition of the textbook are not fully available. Where necessary, I will recreat  
examples usi+ng equivalent public datasets or custom case studies relevant to Solico and the Iranian market. The course'  
learning value, which is based on conceptual thinking, will not be compromised.
