# Syllabus & Course Structure

This page contains all the logistical details for our 14-week program.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

-   **Develop scientific thinking** as a decision-making mindset.
-   Understand the evolution of decision-making: from intuition to data to structured uncertainty.
-   **Frame business problems** as decision problems under uncertainty.
-   **Think probabilistically:** understand randomness, variation, and the role of distributions.
-   Interpret statistical results (e.g., p-values, regression output) critically and in context.
-   Use regression, simulation, and decision trees as part of a broader decision-making strategy.
-   Move beyond predictive modeling to **decision modeling**.
-   Build confidence in evaluating analyses, identifying flaws, and asking sharper questions.
-   Translate business intuition into modelsâ€”and model results back into strategic decisions.

## Course Structure

-   **Total Duration:** 14 weeks
-   **Total Hours:** 56 hours
    -   **Main Weekly Lecture:** 3 hours per week (interactive Q&A + structured lecture)
    -   **Weekly Problem Solving / Office Hour:** 1 hour per week
-   **Suggested Schedule:** Two sessions per week (3 + 1 hours)

## Materials & Delivery

-   **Thinking Problems:** To spark reflection, you'll receive a problem 3 days before each session.
-   **Weekly Slides:** Conceptual lecture slides will be provided in English.
-   **Jupyter Notebooks (Optional):** Select concepts will be illustrated using Python notebooks to showcase end-to-end workflows and highlight key lessons. No programming knowledge is required.
-   **Supplementary Articles:** I will share articles to deepen your understanding.
-   **Lectures:** All live lectures will be delivered in Farsi.

## Assessment, Feedback & Anonymity

Your progress will be supported through practical exercises, projects, and a friendly competition. To encourage honest and thoughtful feedback, we will use an anonymous system for surveys and quizzes.

-   At the start of the course, you will each choose a **random unique ID** (e.g., "Falcon42").
-   Please use this same ID for all surveys and quizzes. This allows me to track learning progress while ensuring your psychological safety.

## Note on Book Data and Tools

The proprietary datasets from the 7th edition of the textbook are not fully available. Where necessary, I will recreate examples usi+ng equivalent public datasets or custom case studies relevant to Solico and the Iranian market. The course's learning value, which is based on conceptual thinking, will not be compromised.
