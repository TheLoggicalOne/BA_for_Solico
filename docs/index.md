- Work on [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PHpVPqGiuEuHjzC6EJMEaztyuwrnXobEEHUBNRirstM/edit?usp=sharing) online, you will see the problem with using percentages when  
quantities can be negative
       - I am not satisfied with how I explained this concept in class, I hope it will click when  
       you work with  numbers yourself
- You can download all excel files form [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RuTdPAAchJs_Ki-M3ssc4E8CTPgHc8xQ?usp=sharing) (if you did not get them from Ms Tardast)

## What should you do as a learner?
- Check this page for latest updates and To Do

- Work on weekly problems and thinking problems
- Find real problems in your life and your job that are really interesting to you, you could suggest your problem [here](Do you know of an interesting, real-world decision-making problem that could benefit from a "Solico" (Scientific/Logical/Quantitative) approach? Share it here! Your suggestions could become future case studies or assignments in this course):
- Constantly think about mathematical models that you use and their limitation in presenting real world factors and relations
- Find an interesting projects to work on

- Help us make the course better by sharing your thought, suggestions, feedback and critique
       - For General Feedback, Suggestions & Critique go [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8HgdzPOfXLeA-DdmZKH_e_2bcZX5spWLgaPUicsoSgSpqxA/viewform?usp=header)
       - Fill weekly survey and quizes , you could find them in each week page

- Be patient! Learning deep concepts is difficult and gradual, keep trying patiently, it will finally click. 

- Think, Think, Think....Think about your thinking
