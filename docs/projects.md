## Mini-Projects
Throughout the course, there will be **3+ mini-projects** focused on applying specific analytical techniques (e.g., simulation, regression, optimization) to a business case. These will be guided exercises designed to build your confidence and modeling skills in Excel.

I will provide constructive feedback and analysis of each participant's performance.

## The Solico Analytics Competition
In the second half of the course, we will hold a friendly "Kaggle-like" internal competition.

-   **Goal:** You will be given a real or synthetic dataset and a defined business objective.
-   **Task:** Your team will analyze the data, build a model, and generate actionable insights.
-   **Evaluation:** Teams will be evaluated not just on predictive accuracy, but on the **interpretability, business impact, and communication** of their models.
-   **Finale:** The final results and team presentations will take place in Week 14.

This is a chance to put everything together in a collaborative and competitive environment.

## "Best Problem" Award
To encourage real-world thinking and connect our learning directly to Solico's goals, we will have a "Best Problem" award.

-   **Submission Deadline:** By the end of Week 5.
-   **Task:** Each participant must propose one business problem or opportunity within Solico Group that could be addressed using the methods from this course.
    - You could suggest up to 3 problems, at different stages and choose the best one with our help
-   **Criteria:** The idea should be well-formulated (clearly defining the problem, the potential data, and the expected impact) and impactful.
-   **Award:** The most impactful and well-formulated idea will win the Best Problem Award. This is a great opportunity to get expert feedback on a problem that matters to you and the company.
