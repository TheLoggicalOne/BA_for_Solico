Uncertainty (The Real World)","text":"<p>This is the biggest challenge. After you make a choice, the final outcome is often random. -   You launch a product, but you don't know what competitor actions or economic shifts will occur. -   You invest in a stock, but its future price is uncertain.</p> <p>Your best choice depends on what could happen. This is where we must move beyond simple numbers and start thinking about probability distributions. The mathematical model of an uncertain future is not a single value, but a range of possibilities and their likelihoods.</p> <p>This is the motivation for simulation. If you had a superpower that let you live a thousand different lives for each choice you make, you could see all the potential outcomes and then come back to pick the choice that worked out best on average.
